Here's a list of common things to rule out when troubleshooting issues:
- first, make sure you have carefully followed all steps in the README.
- are you up to date on the latest git commit?
- have you run npm install and npm build --prefix functions since the last time you pulled from git?
- have you setup your .env file as described in the readme including the functions API endpoint?
- is one and only one instance of your emulator running (on the ports expected)?
- have you created a user group in treat toolbox?
- have you setup traits, values for each trait, and artwork, and mapped each piece of artwork to a trait and trait value?
- are the rarities of your trait values set between 0 and 1?
- do you have enough trait values setup so that multiplying the number of trait values together for each trait exceeds your requested supply? (ideally *significantly* exceeds to account for things like conflict resolution)
- are your art files all PNGs?
- do you have adequate disk space to generate lots of PNGs?
- what version of java are you running? (on mac have you tried OpenJDK through homebrew?
