# Welcome to the Treat Toolbox contributing guide <!-- omit in toc -->

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project!

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose). 

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/github/docs/issues) to find one that interests you. The [help wanted](https://github.com/theskeletoncrew/treat-toolbox/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) label is a good place to start.  Feel free to open a PR for any issue you find to work on though! We welcome all contributions.  

### Make Changes

1. Fork the repository (ex. [using the command line](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository))

2. Install all dependencies as described in the [README](https://github.com/theskeletoncrew/treat-toolbox/blob/main/README.md)

3. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

4. Test your changes locally and ensure that they work as expected.


### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them.  

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request (PR).
- Describe your changes thoroughly, so that reviewers understand your changes, the purpose of your pull request, and how to test that they are correct. 
- Don't forget to link your PR to an issue if you are solving one.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations :sparkles: Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible.
